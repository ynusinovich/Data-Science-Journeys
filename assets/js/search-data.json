          "content": "I’m Yan Nusinovich, a Data Scientist living in Toronto and working remotely for a financial tech startup in the SF Bay Area. I’m creating predictive models for alternative energy prices in the US power grid. I’m passionate about applying data science to solving real-world problems and making the world a better place. . I’m also a natural language processing stream owner for A.I. Socratic Circles, creating videos, concept shortlists, blog posts, and code to teach people NLP. . I completed the General Assembly Data Science Immersive bootcamp in Toronto. Before data science, I worked for eight years in water quality. I have a professional civil engineer license in the state of California, and a master’s in environmental engineering and a bachelor’s in chemistry, both from U.C. Berkeley. . In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, cooking, and listening to new music. I’ve been to about 35 countries, done over 200 hikes, made at least 50 dishes from around the world, and gone to over 100 concerts of different genres. .
