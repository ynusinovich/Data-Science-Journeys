I’m working on analyzing and creating predictive models for alternative energy prices in the US power grid. I’m passionate about applying data science to solving real-world problems and making the world a better place. . I’m also a natural language processing stream owner for A.I. Socratic Circles, creating videos, concept shortlists, blog posts, and code to teach people NLP. . I studied data science at the General Assembly bootcamp in Toronto. Before data science, I worked for eight years in water quality. I have a professional civil engineer license in the state of California, and a master’s in environmental engineering and a bachelor’s in chemistry, both from U.C. Berkeley. . In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, hiking, cooking, and going to concerts. I’ve been to about 35 countries, and I’m interested in foods and music from all over the world. .",
